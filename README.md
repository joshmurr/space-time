# Space Time
Space Time generates real-time space usage information from CELCAT to display outside rooms.

The interface is entirely templated so it can be modified to customise colours, branding, fonts, etc... This would be best done by cloneing `/views/room7.pug` into a new file and changing the mode in `displays.json` to the file name of your new template.

Custom brands can be put in the static folder as an SVG file.
